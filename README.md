# The Retirement Planning System `api-service`

I initially created this project for a software design class and decided to continue updating it
to apply new things I have learned about Spring Boot as well as software development in general.

## Run tests

`./mvnw test`

## Run the application locally

`./mvnw spring-boot:run`

### Several online resources helped me learn Spring Boot well enough to create this application:
